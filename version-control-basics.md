# Version Control Basics

## Definition of Version Control
Version control is a system that tracks and manages changes to files over time. It allows developers to collaborate effectively, maintain a detailed history of changes, and revert to previous versions when necessary.

## Key Features of Git
- **Distributed Version Control**: Every developer has a complete copy of the repository, enabling offline work and redundancy.
- **Branching and Merging**: Allows developers to work on multiple features or fixes simultaneously and merge changes seamlessly.
- **Commit History**: Tracks all changes made to the code with detailed commit messages.
- **Collaboration**: Facilitates teamwork through tools like pull requests, issue tracking, and code reviews.
- **Efficiency**: Optimized for speed and minimal storage use, even with large projects.
